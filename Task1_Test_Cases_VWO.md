Define hypothesis and target URL.<br>4. Configure variations in Visual Editor.<br>5. Launch test. | Test is launched and status changes to 'Running'. Variations are live on target URL. | P0 |
| **TC03** | Functional | Verify Audience Targeting Configuration | A/B Test creation in progress. | 1. In 'Audience' step, select 'Custom Segment'.<br>2. Add condition: 'Device' is 'Mobile'.<br>3. Save segment. | Segment is saved. Test only runs for mobile users (verifiable in preview). | P1 |
| **TC04** | Functional | Verify SmartStats Analysis | A test has been running and collecting data. | 1. Navigate to 'Reporting' for the active test.<br>2. View the 'SmartStats' tab. | Bayesian analysis results, probability of success, and confidence intervals are displayed. | P0 |
| **TC05** | Functional | Verify Heatmap Generation | VWO Insights enabled on target page. | 1. Navigate to 'Insights' > 'Heatmaps'.<br>2. Create new heatmap for a specific URL.<br>3. Simulate user traffic/clicks on the detailed URL. | Heatmap data (clicks, scroll depth) is captured and visualized in the dashboard. | P1 |
| **TC06** | Functional | Verify Integration with Google Analytics | VWO and GA accounts available. | 1. Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Integrations'.<br>2. Select 'Google Analytics'.<br>3. Enable integration and map custom dimensions. | Integration status is 'Connected'. VWO test data appears in GA. | P1 |
| **TC07** | Functional | Verify Personalization Campaign Setup | User has access to Personalize module. | 1. Create 'Personalization' campaign.<br>2. Define segment (e.g., 'Returning Visitors').<br>3. Modify content for this segment via Visual Editor.<br>4. Publish. | Returning visitors see modified content; new visitors see original. | P1 |
| **TC08** | Negative | Verify Login with Invalid Password | User account exists. | 1. Navigate to login page.<br>2. Enter valid username and invalid password.<br>3. Click Login. | Access denied. Error message indicating invalid credentials (exact text needs clarification). | P1 |
| **TC09** | Negative | Verify Access to Restricted Features | User logged in with 'Viewer' role. | 1. Attempt to create a new experiment.<br>2. Attempt to modify account settings. | 'Create' buttons are disabled or hidden. Action forbidden error if accessed via URL. | P1 |
| **TC10** | Negative | Verify Invalid Target URL Handling | A/B Test creation in progress. | 1. In 'URL' step, enter an invalid URL format (e.g., `htp://invalid`).<br>2. Attempt to proceed. | Validation error: "Please enter a valid URL." | P2 |
| **TC11** | Boundary | Verify Performance - Workflow Editing Response | Network speed is stable. | 1. Open a complex campaign in Visual Editor.<br>2. Make an edit (e.g., change text).<br>3. Measure time until system responds/saves. | System responds within 2 seconds (Non-Functional Req). | P2 |
| **TC12** | Boundary | Verify Scalability - High Visitor Volume | Simulation of high traffic load. | 1. Simulate high volume of hits to a test URL (approaching plan limits).<br>2. Monitor VWO response latency and data capture. | No performance loss or data drops observed. | P2 |
| **TC13** | Boundary | Verify Max Variations in Multivariate Test | MVT Test creation. | 1. Create MVT test.<br>2. Add maximum allowed number of sections and variations (Limit needs clarification).<br>3. Save. | System handles max variations gracefully. Error if limit exceeded. | P2 |
| **TC14** | Edge | Verify Concurrent Editing in Workflow | Two users with access to same campaign. | 1. User A opens Campaign X in editor.<br>2. User B opens Campaign X in editor.<br>3. Both make changes and save simultaneously. | System handles concurrency (lock mechanism or merge conflict resolution - needs clarification on specific existing behavior). | P2 |
| **TC15** | Edge | Verify Data Privacy - GDPR Compliance | User data collected. | 1. Initiate a 'Right to be Forgotten' request for a specific visitor ID.<br>2. Verify data removal from VWO logs. | User data is anonymized or deleted within SLA timeframe. | P1 |
| **TC16** | Edge | Verify Session Recording with PII | User inputs sensitive data on page. | 1. Configure Session Recording.<br>2. User visits page and enters credit card/password.<br>3. Review recording. | Sensitive fields should be automatically masked/redacted (Standard privacy expectation, verify config). | P1 |
| **TC17** | Functional | Verify Cross-Domain Tracking (Split Test) | Site spans multiple domains. | 1. Set up Split URL test across Domain A and Domain B.<br>2. User navigates from A to B.<br>3. Verify visitor tracking consistency. | Visitor ID persists; conversion attributes correctly to the original variation. | P2 |
| **TC18** | Functional | Verify Real-Time Reporting Latency | Active test running. | 1. Trigger a conversion event on the test page.<br>2. Check 'Reporting' dashboard immediately. | Conversion count increments within acceptable "real-time" latency (e.g., < 1-5 mins). | P1 |
| **TC19** | Edge | Verify Preview Mode Across Browsers | Test created with browser-specific code. | 1. Open 'Preview' mode.<br>2. Generate preview links for Chrome, Firefox, Safari.<br>3. Open each link in respective browser. | Variations render correctly according to browser-specific CSS/JS. | P2 |
| **TC20** | Negative | Verify Integration Failure Handling (API Down) | External integration (e.g., Salesforce) is down/unreachable. | 1. Configure Salesforce integration.<br>2. Simulate API timeout/failure.<br>3. Check VWO error logs/retry mechanism. | System logs error; core VWO functionality remains unaffected (Fail gracefully). | P2 |
